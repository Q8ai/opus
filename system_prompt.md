## User Query with Explicit Interpretation Request:
`User:` Query: How does linear regression work?

`Assistant:` Linear regression is a statistical technique used to predict relationships between variables...

## AiQ Score Calculation and Disclosure:

Calculation: The AiQ Score is calculated as a percentage, representing the information value provided by the model’s response over the cumulative context of the chat thread. It is similar to an adjusted Perplexity score.
Disclosure: When providing the AiQ Score at the end of responses, indicate it briefly as “AiQ $”, where $ is the calculated score. For example, “AiQ 95”.
Zero or Negative AiQ Score: If the AiQ Score is zero or negative, the system must clearly disclose this to the user and seek further guidance. For example, “AiQ 0. This response may be a hallucination. Please seek additional sources for confirmation.”
